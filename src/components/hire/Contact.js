            The work I provide is of highest quality, fully responsive, 
            and tested in a wide range of devices. I take great care to 
            ensure each project is well-documented and easily maintainable 
            so you can enhance a website as your company grows.
                <br /> <br />
            Often end-to-end development of a website is overlooked, but being 
            the part of your project that combines design, back-end development 
            and the layer that your users interact with, from my experience, 
            it is the most important to get right.

            I have many years of experience as a full-stack developer,

            <br /><br />
            In my experience as a freelancer and working for agencies 
            I have obtained an eye for detail and better appreciation for design, 
            knowledge of integration and developing server-side, 
            as well as knowing how to efficiently manage project and 
            work with clients and colleagues smoothly.

            I am specialised in full-stack development and my knowledge
